reversing a linked list 

    NODE *current = head, *previous = null,     *NEXT;
    while(current != NULL)
    {
        NEXT = current->next;
        current->next = previous;
        previous = current;
        current = NEXT;
    }
    head = previous;


Recursively-----------------------------

    if(traverse->next = NULL)
    {
        head = traverse
        return
    }
    reverse_recursive(Node *traverse);
    Node *temp = traverse->next;
    temp->next = traverse;
    traverse->next = NULL;
